# Design-Portfolio

While honing my design skills, I found value in applying these skills to address a common UI problem I have seen in my career as a bioinformatician: the landing pages of biological databases/tools. During my initial interactions with bioinformatic resources, I often encountered confusion, investing considerable time navigating and learning about the resources and workflows the website had to offer if I had no prior knowledge or instruction. 
    
Drawing from these past encounters, I chose to challenge my UI/UX knowledge by redesigning some of such websites in a manner I perceived would cater to users with varying levels of prior knowledge. In this repository you can explore my redesigns along with the rationale behind them!
